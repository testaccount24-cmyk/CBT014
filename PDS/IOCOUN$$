                   Note about IO counts in your jobs

I have included Greg Price's IEFU83 exit package that is in member
$$IEFU83.  This exit will effectively report on all the I/O counts
and further information that is related, using the SMF exit IEFU83
which Greg has coded.

Example of IEFU93 output (folded over to fit into 80 columns:

U83P14I  INPUT QSAM FILE SYSIN    CLOSED  3 EXCPS FOR SBGOLOB.B.ASM(NUMREPL)
                                  BLKSZ=27920    27KB
U83P14I  INPUT BPAM FILE SYSLIB   CLOSED 94 EXCPS FOR SYS1.MACLIB
                                  BLKSZ=27920
U83V15I OUTPUT QSAM FILE SYSLIN   CLOSED  2 EXCPS FOR
                                  SYS19195.T094202.RA000.SBGOLOBU.TEMP.H01
                                  BLKSZ=3200      6KB
IEF142I SBGOLOBU ASMH - STEP WAS EXECUTED - COND CODE 0000

So you see the kind of information which this exit supplies.  It is even
better than the old I/O count zap, which became difficult to implement,
once IBM developed System Managed Storage (SMS) which caused many module
changes and code path changes.
